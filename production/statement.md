Creative technologist, artist, designer, those all apply to me. I like to think more about the process, and how that can connect to solutions. My work is seldom self-serving, and can sometimes be seen as thrifty, often not deemed as art. I consider incorporating multiple mediums before embarking on a project. Using code to build dynamic content available by accessing it through the web is interesting to me.

A goal of mine is to position me as a Creative Director at a creative design firm, building, and developing access to solutions through design. I find this to be rather satisfying. Incorporating the skills that I'm cultivating while attending Parsons is vital to me being able to compete with today's market.

For me working cross-disciplinary would often present challenges that open up more thinking about design and application.
