Creative technologist, artist, designer, Those all apply to me. I like to think more about the process and how that can connect to solution. My work is seldom self serving, and can somtimes be seen as trifty or not considered art. I consider multiple mediums before embarking on a project. Using code to build dynamic content available by the web is interesting to me.

A goal of mine is to position myself as a Creative Director at a creative design firm. Creating access to solutions through design can be rather satisfying. Incorporating the skills that im cultivating while attending Parsons is supposed to get me there sooner than later.
